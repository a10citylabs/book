# Introduction

This is the introduction to your book. You can write freely in Markdown with all the usual formatting:

## Subheadings work

As do **bold**, *italic*, and `code` formatting.

> Blockquotes render nicely in e-readers.

Lists work too:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

And code blocks:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, reader!")
```
